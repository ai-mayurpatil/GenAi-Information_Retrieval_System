# GenAi-Information_Retrieval_System
This end-to-end project leverages LangChain, LLMs, VectorDB, and Streamlit to build a robust information retrieval system powered by generative AI. The system integrates advanced language models with vector databases for efficient data retrieval and a Streamlit interface for user interaction.
